	format.


0.03    2008-12-27

	* Removed display of "php: not found" error messages when
	probing for PHP command line binary. (It does not matter any

	command line binary is not available).

	line binary. Previously we did not notice missing configuration
	files.

	* Added a test for checking proper detection of missing
	Joomla! configuration file.
